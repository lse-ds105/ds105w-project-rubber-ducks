## Motivations

## How will we get the data?

We plan to use the historical weather API from [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#start_date=2024-02-13&end_date=2024-02-24&hourly=rain).

- [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#start_date=2024-02-13&end_date=2024-02-24&hourly=rain) is an open source weather API which offers free access for non-commercial users.
- It allows you to request data for different time periods and locations and has a variety of both hourly and daily variables.
- For non-commericial users it has a limit of 10 API calls per day, but we suspect that this shouldn't be a limiting factor for us.
