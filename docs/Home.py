## _Is London a rainy city?_
"""

st.image("docs/images/LondonPuddle.JPG")

"""
This is the central question we seek to answer with this project. For many tourists around the world, there is a widely held belief that London is a particularly rainy city where it is unwise to go anywhere without an umbrella or a raincoat and the spectre of a raincloud threatens to ruin any day out you may have planned...but is this actually the case?
"""

st.image("docs/images/LondonSkyline.JPG")

"""
Having spent the last one or two years living in this wonderful city, our group believes that this characterisation is unfair and that London is actually a really great city to visit - especially in the summer when the locals flock to the [Serpentine Lido](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/visit/parks/hyde-park/serpentine-lido) or the [Hampstead Heath Ponds](https://www.hampsteadheath.net/swimming-ponds) to cool off in the hot summer sun.
