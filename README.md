# Rubber Ducks Weather Analysis Project ðŸ¦†

## Our website link is:
[Rubber Ducks Weather Analysis Project](https://lse-ds105-ds105w-project-rubber-ducks-docshome-eaej5q.streamlit.app/) built using Streamlit.

## How to use this repository
The repository is organised into three main folders:
- Data
- Docs
- Notebooks

The notebooks folder is where all of the code that we used to gather and analyse our data is housed along with our ```custom_functions.py``` module. We chose to separate our code into **NB01-Data_Collection** and **NB02-Data_Analysis** so we could work on one task without disrupting the other.

The data folder is where we saved all of our data to once we had finished collecting it. Firstly it was saved as CSVs and JSONs before being combined into a SQL database for storage and querying efficiencies.

Finally, the docs folder contains the contents of our webpage.

## Set Up
### Create a new conda environment

Please create a new conda environment using the following terminal commands:
```bash
conda create -n venv-rubberducks python=3.11 ipython
conda activate venv-rubberducks
```
Install ```pip``` before installing the other required packages.
```bash
conda install pip
```
Use ```pip``` to install the ```requirements.txt```.
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You should now be ready to use our repository.
